# Component Deep Dives

Use this directory for focused, implementation-level documentation. Create a dedicated file per
component or subsystem and include:

- The owning module(s) in the repository.
- Configuration and environment dependencies.
- Interaction points with other components.
- Known limitations or TODOs tied to GitHub issues.

Suggested topics:

- `backend/app/agents/` catalogue and orchestration flow.
- Machine-learning retraining loop (`learning_pipeline.py` and related schedulers).
- Response workflow executor internals (`advanced_response_engine.py`, `response_optimizer.py`).
- Frontend incident workspace (`frontend/app/incidents/`).
- Infrastructure automation (`infrastructure/`, `k8s/`, `scripts/start-all.sh`).

Add new files as you document each subsystem and update the index below.
