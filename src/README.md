# Source Layout

The project code stays under two main stacks:
- `backend/app/`: FastAPI services, agents, pipelines, and ML models
- `frontend/`: Next.js UI (app router)

Keep new Python or TypeScript modules under these stacks; this `src/` folder exists as a pointer for contributors browsing the repo root.
