## Overview

Mini-XDR implements a two-layer detection architecture:

- **Layer 1 (Fast ML)**: Ensemble ML models process events in <50ms using 79-dimensional feature extraction
- **Layer 2 (Council of Models)**: Multi-LLM reasoning with Gemini, Grok, and OpenAI for uncertain predictions

The system coordinates 12 specialized agents for threat detection, containment, forensics, attribution, and automated response.

## AI Agents

Mini-XDR deploys **12 specialized AI agents** that work collaboratively:

| Agent | Capability | Key Features |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Containment Agent** | Autonomous threat response | LangChain orchestration, IP blocking, host isolation, honeypot-aware containment |
| **Forensics Agent** | Digital forensics & evidence | Evidence collection, chain of custody, timeline reconstruction, PCAP analysis |
| **Attribution Agent** | Threat actor identification | Campaign correlation, TTP analysis, infrastructure clustering, actor signatures |
| **Deception Agent** | Honeypot management | Dynamic honeypot deployment (Cowrie, Dionaea, Conpot), attacker profiling |
| **EDR Agent** | Endpoint detection & response | Process control, file quarantine, registry monitoring |
| **IAM Agent** | Identity & access management | Active Directory monitoring, credential protection, privilege analysis |
| **DLP Agent** | Data loss prevention | Sensitive data scanning, exfiltration blocking, upload monitoring |
| **Predictive Hunter** | Proactive threat hunting | Time-series forecasting, behavioral baselines, hypothesis generation |
| **NLP Analyzer** | Natural language interface | Semantic search, query parsing, analyst-friendly insights |
| **Ingestion Agent** | Multi-source ingestion | Syslog, CEF, JSON normalization, deduplication |
| **Coordination Hub** | Multi-agent orchestration | Conflict resolution, decision optimization, collaborative intelligence |
| **LangChain Orchestrator** | ReAct-style orchestration | GPT-4 powered tool selection, multi-step reasoning |

## Council of Models

The Council provides **multi-LLM reasoning** for uncertain predictions (ML confidence between 0.5-0.9):

### Gemini Judge
Deep reasoning engine with 1M+ token context. Analyzes the 79-dimensional feature vector and event timeline to verify or override ML predictions. Provides explainable reasoning for SOC analysts.

### Grok Intel
Real-time threat intelligence from X (Twitter). Queries security researcher discussions about file hashes, domains, and IPs. Returns social proof of malicious activity.

### OpenAI Remediation
Generates precise remediation scripts:
- Firewall rules (Palo Alto, Cisco, iptables)
- PowerShell/Bash response scripts
- Network isolation commands
- Step-by-step action plans

---

## Machine Learning

### Feature Engineering
Extracts **79 features** from security events covering:
- Temporal patterns (event frequency, time windows)
- Network behavior (port diversity, connection patterns)
- Authentication metrics (failed logins, brute force indicators)
- Payload analysis (command patterns, malware signatures)
- Behavioral baselines (deviation scores)

### Detection Models

| Model | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **XDRThreatDetector** | Deep Neural Network | Multi-class threat classification |
| **XDRAnomalyDetector** | Autoencoder | Unsupervised anomaly detection via reconstruction error |
| **LSTMAttentionDetector** | LSTM + Attention | Sequential attack pattern recognition |
| **IsolationForest** | Ensemble | Outlier-based anomaly detection |
| **XGBoost** | Gradient Boosting | High-precision threat scoring |

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Ensemble Optimizer**: Weighted voting with model agreement scoring
- **Federated Learning**: Distributed model training across deployments
- **Concept Drift Detection**: Automatic model retraining on distribution shift
- **Explainable AI**: Feature importance and decision reasoning

## T-Pot Honeypot Integration

Real-time integration with [T-Pot](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce) honeypot infrastructure:

- **SSH Monitoring**: Secure tunnel to T-Pot for log streaming
- **Supported Honeypots**: Cowrie, Dionaea, Suricata, Conpot, ElasticHoney, and more
- **Automated Response**: UFW-based IP blocking, container management
- **Elasticsearch Queries**: Direct access to honeypot attack data

**Data Flow:**
1. Attackers hit T-Pot honeypots (SSH, HTTP, malware, etc.)
2. Honeypots log attacks to JSON files
3. `TPotConnector` streams events via SSH tunnel
4. Events processed through ML pipeline → AI agents
5. Defensive actions executed on T-Pot infrastructure

---

## Playbook Engine

SOAR-style workflow automation with built-in playbooks:

- **SSH Brute Force Response**: Rate limiting → IP blocking → forensic collection
- **Malware Detection**: File quarantine → hash analysis → attribution lookup
- **Lateral Movement**: Host isolation → credential reset → network sweep
- **Data Exfiltration**: Connection termination → data audit → compliance notification
- **Comprehensive Investigation**: Full forensic case with timeline reconstruction

Playbooks support:
- Conditional execution based on incident context
- Parallel step execution with dependency graphs
- Rollback actions for containment reversal
- AI-powered action suggestions

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tactical Decision Center** | Real-time incident queue with AI recommendations |
| **Enhanced AI Analysis** | LLM-generated threat insights and context |
| **Workflow Designer** | Visual drag-and-drop playbook builder |
| **Threat Status Bar** | Live attack metrics and trend indicators |
| **Action History Panel** | Full audit trail of response actions |
| **Honeypot Dashboard** | T-Pot attack monitoring and container control |
| **NLP Query Interface** | Natural language incident search |
