# Attack Log Examples

Use this folder to store sanitized attack traces for demos and tests. Suggested structure:
- `cowrie/` for SSH honeypot samples
- `suricata/` for IDS alerts
- `osquery/` for endpoint telemetry

Existing raw captures live under `evidence/` and `data/`; copy only redacted snippets here before sharing.
